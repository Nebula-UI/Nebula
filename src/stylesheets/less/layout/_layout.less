/**
 * Layout rules:
 *
 * Layout styles can also be divided into major and minor styles based on reuse.
 * Major layout styles such as header and footer are traditionally styled using
 * ID selectors but take the time to think about the elements that are common across
 * all components of the page and use class selectors where appropriate.
